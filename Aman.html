            <h1> ABOUT </h1>

            <P>The Indian Armed Forces are the military forces of the Republic of India. It consists of three professional uniformed services: the Indian Army, Indian Navy, and Indian Air Force. Additionally, the Indian Armed Forces are supported by the Central Armed Police Forces, Assam Rifles, Indian Coast Guard and Special Frontier Force and various inter-service commands and institutions such as the Strategic Forces Command, the Andaman and Nicobar Command and the Integrated Defence Staff. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Armed Forces but the executive authority and responsibility for national security is vested in the Prime Minister of India and their chosen Cabinet Ministers. The Indian Armed Forces are under the management of the Ministry of Defence of the Government of India. With strength of over 1.4 million active personnel, it is the world's second-largest military force and has the world's largest volunteer army. It also has the third-largest defence budget in the world.The Global Firepower Index report lists it as the fourth most-powerful military.</P>

            <p><h3>Indian Army</h3> 
                <img src="/web image/indian-army.jpg" width="250px" height="220px" alt="" class="about"> <br><br>
                The Indian Army is the land-based branch and the largest component of the Indian Armed Forces. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army,[3] and its professional head is the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who is a four-star general. Two officers have been conferred with the rank of field marshal, a five-star rank, which is a ceremonial position of great honour. The Indian Army was formed in 1895 alongside the long established presidency armies of the East India Company, which too were absorbed into it in 1903. The princely states had their own armies, which were merged into the national army after independence. The units and regiments of the Indian Army have diverse histories and have participated in several battles and campaigns around the world, earning many battle and theatre honours before and after Independence. 
            <br>
            The primary mission of the Indian Army is to ensure national security and national unity, to defend the nation from external aggression and internal threats, and to maintain peace and security within its borders. It conducts humanitarian rescue operations during natural calamities and other disturbances, such as Operation Surya Hope, and can also be requisitioned by the government to cope with internal threats. It is a major component of national power, alongside the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force.

            <p> <h3>Indian Airforce</h3>
             <img src="/web image/web image.jpeg" width="250px" height="220px" alt="" class="about"> <br><br>
             The Indian Air Force (IAF) is the air arm of the Indian Armed Forces. Its complement of personnel and aircraft assets ranks third [11] amongst the air forces of the world.[citation needed] Its primary mission is to secure Indian airspace and to conduct aerial warfare during armed conflict. It was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary air force of the British Empire which honoured India's aviation service during World War II with the prefix Royal.[12] After India gained independence from United Kingdom in 1947, the name Royal Indian Air Force was kept and served in the name of Dominion of India. With the government's transition to a Republic in 1950, the prefix Royal was removed.
            <br>
            Since 1950, the IAF has been involved in four wars with neighbouring Pakistan. Other major operations undertaken by the IAF include Operation Vijay, Operation Meghdoot, Operation Cactus and Operation Poomalai. The IAF's mission expands beyond engagement with hostile forces, with the IAF participating in United Nations peacekeeping missions.

            <p> <h3>Indian Navy</h3> 
            <img src="/web image/navy.jpeg" width="250px" height="220px" alt="" class="oabout"> <br><br>
            The Indian Navy is the maritime branch of the Indian Armed Forces. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Navy. The Chief of Naval Staff, a four-star admiral, commands the navy. As a blue-water navy, it operates significantly in the Persian Gulf Region, the Horn of Africa, the Strait of Malacca, and routinely conducts anti-piracy operations and partners with other navies in the region. It also conducts routine two to three month-long deployments in the South and East China seas as well as the western Mediterranean sea simultaneously.
            <br>
            The primary objective of the navy is to safeguard the nation's maritime borders, and in conjunction with other Armed Forces of the union, act to deter or defeat any threats or aggression against the territory, people or maritime interests of India, both in war and peace. Through joint exercises, goodwill visits and humanitarian missions, including disaster relief, the Indian Navy promotes bilateral relations between nations.

            <div> <h3>Indian Army : Ranks</h3> 

            1. Field Marshal - <br><br><img src="/web image/field marshal.jpeg" width="250px
            " alt=""> <br><br>
            Field Marshal (or field marshal, abbreviated as FM) is a five–star general officer rank and the highest attainable rank in the Indian Army. Field Marshal is ranked immediately above general, but not exercised in the regular army structure. It is a largely ceremonial or wartime rank, having been awarded only twice. A Field Marshal’s insignia consists of the national emblem over a crossed baton and sabre in a lotus blossom wreath.
            <br> 
            Sam Manekshaw was the first Field Marshal of India, and was conferred the rank on 1 January 1973. The second was Kodandera M. Cariappa, who was conferred the rank on 15 January 1986.

            Field Marshal is equivalent to an admiral of the fleet in the Indian Navy and a Marshal of the Indian Air Force in the Indian Air Force. In the Navy, Admiral of the Fleet has never been awarded, but from the Air Force, Arjan Singh was promoted to the rank of Marshal of the Indian Air Force. <br><br><br>

            2.The Chief of the Army Staff 
            - <br><br><img src="/web image/The Chief of the Army Staff.jpeg" width="250px
            " alt=""> <br><br>
            The Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) (unofficially known as the Army Chief) is a statutory position in the Indian Army held usually by a four star general. As the highest ranking officer to serve solely in the Indian Army, the chief is the professional head of the ground forces and a key adviser to the Minister of Defence. The COAS, in a separate capacity, is also a member of the National Security Council and thereby an advisor to the president and the prime minister. The COAS is typically the most senior army officer in the Indian Armed Forces, unless the Chief of Defence Staff and/or the Chairman Chiefs of Staff Committee is an army officer.
            <br> 
           <br><br><br>

            3. Lieutenant General - <br><br><img src="/web image/Lieutenant General.jpeg" width="250px
            " alt=""> <br><br>
            Lieutenant general is a three-star general officer rank in the Indian Army. It is the second-highest active rank in the Indian Army. Lieutenant generals rank above the two-star rank of Major General and below the four-star rank of General, which is held by the Chief of the Army Staff.

            The equivalent rank in the Indian Navy is Vice Admiral and in the Indian Air Force is Air Marshal.

            Officers in the rank of lieutenant general hold important appointments at the army commands and at the army headquarters

            <div> <h3>Indian Navy : Ranks</h3> 
                
            1. Admiral - <br><br><img src="/web image/Admiral.jpeg" width="250px
            " alt=""> <br><br>
            Admiral is a four-star naval flag officer rank in the Indian Navy. It is the highest active rank in the Indian Navy. Admiral ranks above the three-star rank of vice admiral and below the five-star rank of admiral of the fleet, which has never been awarded or held.

            An admiral may be referred to as a full admiral or four-star admiral to distinguish them from lower flag officer ranks like vice admiral and rear admiral.

            <br> 
            The rank is held by the Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS), the professional head of the Indian Navy, since 1968. The rank may also be held by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) if the holder is a serving Indian Navy flag officer. Admiral Adhar Kumar Chatterji was the first Indian officer to hold the rank of full admiral.[1] The current Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) and only full admiral in the Indian Armed Forces is Admiral R. Hari Kumar.<br><br><br>



            2. Vice Admiral - <br><br><img src="/web image/Vice Admiral.jpeg" width="250px
            " alt=""> <br><br>
            The Vice Chief of the Naval Staff (VCNS) is a statutory position in the Indian Armed Forces, that is usually held by a three star vice admiral. The Vice Chief is the deputy of the Chief of the Naval Staff and is usually the second highest ranking officer of the Indian Navy. The current VCNS is Vice Admiral Satish Namdeo Ghormade who took over from Vice Admiral G. Ashok Kumar on 31 July 2021.
            <br> 
            Established on 11 May 1967, the office was first held by Sourendra Nath Kohli, subsequently appointed CNS. The appointment was then in the two-star rank of rear admiral.[2] On 12 December 1967, Nilakanta Krishnan succeeded Kohli as VCNS, with the office being raised to the three-star rank of Vice-Admiral in March 1969.  <br><br><br>

            3. Rear Admiral - <br><br><img src="/web image/Rear Admiral.jpeg" width="250px
            " alt=""> <br><br>
            Rear admiral is a senior naval flag officer rank, equivalent to a major general and air vice marshal and above that of a commodore and captain, but below that of a vice admiral. It is regarded as a two star "admiral" rank. It is often regarded as a two-star rank with a NATO code of OF-7.
            <br> 
            The term originated in the days of naval sailing squadrons and can trace its origins to the Royal Navy. Each naval squadron was assigned an admiral as its head, who commanded from the centre vessel and directed the squadron's activities. The admiral would in turn be assisted by a vice admiral, who commanded the lead ships that bore the brunt of a battle. In the rear of the squadron, a third admiral commanded the remaining ships and, as this section was considered to be in the least danger, the admiral in command of it was typically the most junior. This has continued into the modern age, with rear admiral the most junior admiralty of many navies.

            <div> <h3>Indian Airforce : Ranks</h3> 
                
            1. Marshal - <br><br><img src="web image/Marshal.jpeg" width="240px
            " alt=""> <br><br>
            Marshal is a term used in several official titles in various branches of society. As marshals became trusted members of the courts of Medieval Europe, the title grew in reputation. During the last few centuries, it has been used for elevated offices, such as in military rank and civilian law enforcement.
            <br> 
            In most countries, the rank of Marshal is the highest Army rank (equivalent to a five-star General of the Army in the United States). <br><br><br>

            2. Air-Chief Marshal - <br><br><img src="/web image/Air-Chief Marshal.jpeg" width="250px
            " alt=""> <br><br>
            Air chief marshal (Air Chf Mshl or ACM) is a high-ranking air officer originating from the Royal Air Force. The rank is used by air forces of many countries that have historical British influence. An air chief marshal is equivalent to an Admiral in a navy or a full general in an army or other nations' air forces.
            <br> 
            The rank of air chief marshal is immediately senior to the rank of air marshal but subordinate to marshal of the air force. Air chief marshals are sometimes generically considered to be air marshals.<br><br><br>

            3. Air Commodore - <br><br><img src="/web image/Air Commodore.jpeg" width="250px
            " alt=""> <br><br>
            Air commodore (abbreviated as Air Cdre in the RAF, and PAF; Air Cmde in the IAF, AIR CDRE in the RNZAF and RAAF) is a one-star rank and is an air officer (Flag Rank, Deputy Director General Level) rank which originated in and continues to be used by the Royal Air Force.
            <br> 
            The rank is also used by the air forces of many countries which have historical British influence such as Zimbabwe, and it is sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in countries which have a non-English air force-specific rank structure. The name of the rank is always the full phrase; it is never shortened to "commodore", which is a rank in various naval forces.
